## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Even though I had encountered it before, the `flex:wrap` property gave me a little headache in this challenge. But, I was able to overcome the issue, and in the process, really understood what combination of properties allow it to work.

### Continued development

I will keep working to improve my understanding and application of responsive designs.
